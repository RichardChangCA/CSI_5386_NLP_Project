Image Captioning: CNN + RNN (Computer Vision + Natural Language Processing)

Lingfeng Zhang(University of Ottawa)

Yu Sun(Carleton University)

Contents: CNN encoders(VGG16,InceptionV3,MobileNet,ResNet) by transfer learning, RNN decoders(stacked LSTM, GRU with attention mechanism), Evaluation Metrics(BLEU,CIDEr,METEOR), Datasets(Flickr8k, COCO), Django Web Application with the best performance model.

You need download Flickr8k in person. In addtion, you need run ./Image_captioning_with_visual_attention/Image_captioning_with_visual_attention.py first to get annotation files and image datasets.

Run ./Comparison/Comparison.py to get the final results.
